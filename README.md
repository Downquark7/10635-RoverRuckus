# 10635-RoverRuckus
This is the code that was running on team 10635's robot. It's built on https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart. Hopefully this code shows people how to improve code in future robots. teleOp.java is a good teleop program so definitely look at it for ideas. teleop.java was replaced by alphaOp.java for improved loop time due to Rev Extensions 2.
