# 10635-RoverRuckus
This is the code that was running on team 10635's robot. It's built on https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart. Hopefully this code shows people how to improve code in future robots. alphaOp.java is one of the best teleop programs so definitely look at it for ideas.
